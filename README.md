# Deposit Information System &middot; [![Streamlit Sharing](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://share.streamlit.io/sanskarvijpuria/deposit-information-system/main/main.py)
A mini project to learn Streamlit and solve a daily problem of mine. 

When you visit the bank 3 to 4 times a week to deposit cash, filling out the deposit slip might become tiresome.
This system computes the overall amount of money, the amount of each denomination, and the total amount in words.

This project is created with the help of [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and is also hosted on [Streamlit Sharing](https://share.streamlit.io/sanskarvijpuria/deposit-information-system/main/main.py).

Note: Currently, this is based on the Indian currency system.
